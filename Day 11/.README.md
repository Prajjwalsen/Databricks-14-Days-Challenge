# 🎯 Day 11 – Statistical Analysis & ML Preparation (Databricks)

## 🚀 Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge  
This document captures my learning and hands-on work for **Day 11** of the  
**Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge** by **Indian Data Club**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Descriptive statistics using Spark
- Hypothesis testing (weekday vs weekend)
- Correlation analysis
- Feature engineering for ML pipelines

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed

✅ Calculated statistical summaries  
✅ Performed hypothesis testing (weekday vs weekend behavior)  
✅ Identified correlations between key variables  
✅ Engineered features for ML readiness

## 🧪 Hands-on Implementation

### 🔹 1. Descriptive Statistics
Computed statistical summaries (count, mean, stddev, min, max) for numerical features like price.

---

### 🔹 2. Events Table Verification
Loaded and verified the Silver events table used for analysis.

---

### 🔹 3. Hypothesis Testing (Weekday vs Weekend)
Created a derived column to classify events as weekday or weekend and analyzed user behavior across both.

### 🔹 4. Correlation Analysis
Analyzed correlation between product price and purchase behavior to understand feature relationships.

---

### 🔹 5. Feature Engineering
Engineered new ML-ready features such as:
- Hour of event  
- Day of week  
- Log-transformed price  
- Time since first user interaction (window functions)
